# NYC AirbnbRental Market Analysis
This was my final project at TripleTen. This one was set to mimic a real life scenerio with little help and a general issue to look into.
The goal here was to look at restaurants in India and look at their performance, finding restaurants and cuisines that generate the 
most revenue.

The Tableau dashboard and story can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zach.dominic/viz/FinalProject_17223362773580/RevenueDashboard)

### Process
* Filtered and cleaned large datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability 
* Analyzed restaurants to find the top performers using revenue as the deciding factor
* Created various forms of graphs to visualize findings
* Formed dashboards using the created visuals to compile all key findings
* The insight gained here helps limit the focus on key criteria regarding successful restaurants
