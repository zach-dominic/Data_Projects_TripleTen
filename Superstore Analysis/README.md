# Superstore Analysis
This analysis was the first offical project using Tableau. The goal was to help a superstore by finding its centers of loss and profit,
the best time of the year for advertisements and products with the highest return rate.

The Tableau dashboard can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zach.dominic/viz/Sprint5Project_17187951674870/FinalStory)

### Process
* Use and merge several spreadsheets using the JOIN feature to be the basis for the analysis
* Create clear yet detailed visualizations that solve the main problems
* Use various analytical techniques and Tableau features to ensure quality results
* Findings were presented in a dashboard and later placed into a story for easier understanding
