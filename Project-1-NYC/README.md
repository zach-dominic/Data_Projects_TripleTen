# NYC Airbnb Rental Market Analysis
This was the first project I worked on in TripleTen. Its purpose was to test my knowledge and skill learned on spreasheets.
The goal was to analyze Airbnb listings to help the client find optimal properties to invest in.

### Process
* Filtered and cleaned large datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis
* Analyzed cleaned data to find the optimal investment properties
* Created aggregations and pivot tables to identify the promising types of properties for investment 
* Performed calculations to assess current occupancy rates and estimate potential revenue streams based on various scenarios
* The insights gained from this analysis facilitated data-driven decision-making and contributed to the formulation of effective property investment strategies
